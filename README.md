this will make anything red invisible (even your...mouth), you can change the colour in the code

how it works

- type python invisibilityCloak.py in your terminal (make sure your code editor has permission to open the webcam)
- then straight away move away from webcam (it needs to take a photo if your background, give it 5 seconds)
- then if you have anything red, it will be invisible (can change colour)
- if you have bluetooth on, it might connect to your phone so turn it off.
- Any issues, ask your favourite LLM!

- Enjoy!
